# Haiku-Bot

Every three hours, this guy tweets a haiku (5-7-5) from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
It only chooses haikus that begin with a capital letter, so it is either the start of a sentence or a character's name.
I use cronjobs to schedule the tweet, and can't yet figure out how to include tweets that have a quotation mark.
