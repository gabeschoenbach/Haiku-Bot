Suddenly, people 
were pointing up at Harry 
all over the stands. 

Hermione. "What 
should we do?" "Leave it to me." 
Before Ron could say 

"What should we do?" "Leave

say another word, 

Hermione had 
fought her way across to the 
stand where Snape stood, and 

Malfoy just as Snape 
came up the stairs. "WEASLEY!" Ron 
let go of the front 

"Be that as it may, 
fighting is against Hogwarts 
rules, Hagrid," said Snape 

So the three of them 
followed Hagrid and his tree 
off to -the Great Hall, 

Hagrid had let it 
slip, because how else were they 
going to find out

been his father's. He let the

the blood drain out of his face. 
Wherever he was, 

Harry moved nearer 
to the mirror, wanting to 
look at himself but 

And slowly, Harry 
looked into the faces of 
the other people 

Harry was looking 
at his family, for the 
first time in his life.

the mirror. There was

Walking back from the

He was pale and looked 
as though he was about to
